# toss
Toss -- throw a job like a boss and let it know when it's done!


## Toss It!

```
$ toss sleep 2
```


## Install

Spawn the following commands:

```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eleidan/toss/master/toss
$ chmod a+x toss
$ sudo mv toss /usr/bin/
```

## Unistall

Ah, cmon, you do want to use it! Try it again! No?

Ok, spawn the following command to get rid of this very usefull app:
```
$ sudo rm /usr/bin/toss
```


## TODO
Well, as a lazy user I would be happy to spawn `sudo dpkg -i toss.deb` to install,
and `sudo apt purge toss` to get rid of the app.
